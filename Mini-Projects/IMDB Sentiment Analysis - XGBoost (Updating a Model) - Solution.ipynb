In particular, we will look at the XGBoost sentiment analysis model that we constructed earlier. In this case, however, we have some new data that our model doesn't seem to perform very well on. As a result, we will re-train our model and update an existing endpoint so that it uses our new model.\n",

In part, this is because it is meant to be a little bit closer to the type of problem you may face in a real world scenario. Of course, this problem is a very easy one with a prescribed solution, but there are many other interesting questions that we did not consider here and that you may wish to consider yourself.\n",

    "The default notebook instance on SageMaker doesn't have a lot of excess disk space available. As you continue to complete and execute notebooks you will eventually fill up this disk space, leading to errors which can be difficult to diagnose. Once you are completely finished using a notebook it is a good idea to remove the files that you created along the way. Of course, you can do this from the terminal or from the notebook hub if you would like. The cell below contains some commands to clean up the created files from within the notebook."
